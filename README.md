# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Analysis

Welcome to my SQL project where I analyzed an online bookstore dataset using PostgreSQL. This is a **semi-guided project** — I discovered the dataset on Kaggle and independently explored it by writing both basic and advanced SQL queries, generating insights, and designing a professional presentation.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to uncover insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and inventory management using SQL queries. The [dataset](https://github.com/KomalSharma0/Online-Book-Store-Analysis/tree/main/Dataset) was sourced from Kaggle and includes three relational tables: `Books`, `Customers`, and `Orders`.

I conducted the analysis using **PostgreSQL in pgAdmin** and built a clean, professional presentation in **Canva** for visual storytelling.
