# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Analysis

Welcome to my SQL project where I analyzed an online bookstore dataset using PostgreSQL. This project is inspired by a semi-guided approach — I watched Satish Dhawale’s video for the initial direction but completed the queries, analysis, and presentation independently.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to uncover insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and inventory management using SQL queries. The [dataset](#) was sourced from Kaggle and includes three relational tables: `Books`, `Customers`, and `Orders`.

I conducted the analysis using **PostgreSQL in pgAdmin** and built a clean, professional presentation in **Canva** for visual storytelling. This project is part of my portfolio and also added to my resume to demonstrate practical SQL skills in a real-world context.

- **Customers**: Customer_ID, Name, Email, Phone, City, Country
